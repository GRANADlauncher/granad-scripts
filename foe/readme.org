* GRANAD meets O(N) Methods

** Idea
   Exploit nearsightedness by only including a couple of neighbors.

** Implementation
   - Density Matrix purification + Time Propagation *works for gapped systems only*
   - Spectral Methods

** Density Matrix purificatioon

** Spectral Series

   Expand function $f(O) = \sum_n f_n P_n(O)$. O is operator with ||O|| <= 1.

   $\delta(\omega - H) = \sum_n \Delta_n(\omega) \mathcal{T}_n(H) / (1 + \delta_{n,0})$

   
   $\Delta_n(\omega) = 2 T_n(\omega) / (\pi \sqrt(1 - \omega^2))$ and H has been rescaled with evs between -1 and 1.

   Chebyshev polynomials

   $T_0(X) = 1, T_1(X) = X, T_{n+1}(X) = 2 X T_n(X) - T_{n-1}(X)$

   DOS

   $N\rho(\omega) = Tr(\delta(\omega - H)) = \frac{1}{\pi \sqrt{1 - \omega^2}} \sum_n \mu_n T_n(\omega)$

   Chebyshev moments

   $\mu_n = (1 + \delta_{n,0})/2 Tr[T_n(H)]$

   are evaluated recursively

   1. SpMV for matrix polynomials T_n
   2. Trace is evaluated stochastically

   Singularity in DOS is bad, because one needs more moments, Gibbs ringing. Cure by Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM): Convolve $\mu_n$ with Lorentz kernel $g^L_n = \sinh(\lambda(1 - n / M)) / \sinh(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is resolution parameter s.t. delta fun gets smeared out.

   
   $\sigma = \text{Tr}\left[ v_x T_n v_x T_n \right]$

* Idea
  - Approximate $\rho_{ab}(H) \approx \sum_{n = 0}^M a_n T_n(H)$
  - $\rho_{ab} = \sum_n a_n <i|T_n(H)|j>$
  - T_n typically polynomials, so compute exponentials of H and product with basis vectors $|j>$
  - Chebyshev:
    $|j_{n+1} = 2 H |j_n> - |j_{n-1}>, |j_0> = |j>, |j_1> = H |j_0>$
  - precompute coefficients, neglect for each i all j that have |r_i - r_j| > cutoff => do sparse mat vec muls
